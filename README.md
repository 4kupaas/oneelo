All of these scripts were written by Chaos on EloBuddy. 
I do not endorse scripting. 
I only code scripts to improve my programming knowledge while being directly in contact with a game I enjoy.

Unsigned Evade:
- Evade script that needs a lot of work. I have coded about 30% of the champions abilities and have many, many more to go. Currently, I only have it drawing and not evading to make sure that when I handle movement I use all factors (dashes, invulns, spell shields, walls to stop projectiles, etc). It has the basics to be made great once I finish it.Â 
- UnsignedEvade, unlike other evades, can dodge ALL spells including spells casted instantaneously (Annie R, Amumu R, Katarina E) and can stop spells from ever being casted with forms of CC or denial (Leona Q on Annie R [if Leona's AA speed is less than 0.25], Morgana R against Zhonyas [Morgana's Ult will fail to cast if zhonyas is casted].

Shroom Tracker:
- Tracks enemy Teemos shrooms, so you don't forget about them.

Pick a Card:
- A simple addon to go with other Twisted Fate scripts to help select cards easier.

EloBuddy Helper:
- A program I use to help debug when creating scripts.
